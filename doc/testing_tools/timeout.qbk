[section:timeout Time-out for test cases]

The __UTF__ provides the decorator __decorator_timeout__ that specifies a time-out for a specific *test case*,
The argument time (in seconds) sets the maximum allowed duration of a test case. If this time is
exceeded the test case is reported as failed. On some systems, the __UTF__ is able to force the test-case
to stop.

[bt_example decorator_11..decorator timeout..run-fail]

[note Applied at test suite level, this decorator has no effect.]

[note The macro
  `BOOST_SIGACTION_BASED_SIGNAL_HANDLING` is defined
  if Boost.Test is able to force the test-case to stop. This feature is for instance not supported on Windows.
  The __UTF__ will still be able to report the test-case as failed (once the test-case finishes).]
